# Fetch Rewards Assessment.

## About

> Our users have points in their accounts. Users only see a single balance in their accounts. But for reporting purposes we actually track their points per payer/partner. 
>
> In our system, each transaction record contains: payer (string), points (integer), timestamp (date). For earning points it is easy to assign a payer, we know which actions earned the points. And thus which partner should be paying for the points. When a user spends points, they don't know or care which payer the points come from. But, our accounting team does care how the points are spent. 
>
> There are two rules for determining what points to "spend" first:
>
> 1) We want the oldest points to be spent first (oldest based on transaction timestamp, not the order theyâ€™re received)
>
> 2) We want no payer's points to go negative.


## Technologies Used

> **Programming Language:** [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
>
> **Framework:** [Spring Boot](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring_boot/spring_boot_introduction.htm)
>
> **Database:** [H2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H2_(DBMS))
>
> Here I have used H2 database because using a durable data store was not a requirement. So I am storing transactions in memory using H2.
>
> **Tools:** IntelliJ, Postman
