# Fetch Rewards.

## About

> Our users have points in their accounts. Users only see a single balance in their accounts. But for reporting purposes we actually track their points per payer/partner. 
>
> In our system, each transaction record contains: payer (string), points (integer), timestamp (date). For earning points it is easy to assign a payer, we know which actions earned the points. And thus which partner should be paying for the points. When a user spends points, they don't know or care which payer the points come from. But, our accounting team does care how the points are spent. 
>
> There are two rules for determining what points to "spend" first:
>
> 1) We want the oldest points to be spent first (oldest based on transaction timestamp, not the order theyâ€™re received)
>
> 2) We want no payer's points to go negative.


## Technologies Used

> **Programming Language:** [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
>
> **Framework:** [Spring Boot](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring_boot/spring_boot_introduction.htm)
>
> **Database:** [H2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H2_(DBMS))
>
> Here I have used H2 database because using a durable data store was not a requirement. So I am storing transactions in memory using H2.
>
> **Tools:** IntelliJ, Postman

## Links to download the Tools

> [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
>
> [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
>
> [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

## How to run the project

Step 1: Setting up the tools
> * Download Java, IntelliJ and Postman. Links are given above.
>
> * [Set up java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZbHHLobt8A) in local machine. [Set up java in IntelliJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7IZ6Ckujbw).
> 

Step 2: Setting up the project
> * Using "-git clone" clone the project into your local machine.
>
> * Open IntelliJ. On top click on File->Open. Select the pom.xml in the project folder and select add as project. This will add project into your IntelliJ IDE.

> 
> * Run the project. 

Note: Generally the project starts at localhost:8080  but in case it does not, go to your console and see last second line it will show the port at which your porject is running.

Step 3: Testing the project
> * Now to check our end points(APIs/Services) we would need a postman. Its a tool that will simulate various types of request sent to our webservice. For more details about postman [click here](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/).
>
> * Open postman and import Fetch Rewards.postman_collection from your project folder.
